# automate_desktop
Automate package installation in Ubuntu after a fresh install
-- 

my first "project" using bash 

## Objective

This program is inteneded to:
* adjust temrinal settings, 
* terminal profile, 
* create a bash alises file, 
* install debian packages (apt-get)
** there is a lot of these
* snaps
* some other third-party software.

## Disclaimer
I am sure there are still some bugs need squashing,  so use AT OWN RISK.

enjoy

This should also work on Debian -- I have not tested this
