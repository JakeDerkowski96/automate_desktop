# automate_desktop
Automate, or simplify the configuration of the Ubuntu operating system. To my preferences.


## About

A collection of scripts that automate installation and other common tasks. This is a personal project to increase my knowledge of bash scripting and to expedite my preferred configuration of Ubuntu and to install the applications/packages that I use.


## Alt-automate.sh

**automate.sh**, is the main script, and can trigger all of the other scripts that are included; all are commented out. Uncomment the ones that you want to run. The **package** script will as if a genre of installations is desired, specifics must be manually commented out.

This script will update and add repositories as needed in order to install the application. I intend for there to be nothing displayed on the screen unless it looks pretty. Output will be routed to the **logs** directory and will be appropriately named.



### What to expect

* Install dependencies needed for my preferred configuration
* Make the terminal pretty
* Create terminal shortcuts 
* Install third-party software

As I continue to experiment with bash, network security, and related things, this will be updated with packages that I will use in the future and will make obtaining them easier and faster for ME.
